You should have an understanding of TSM Auction Operations, Crafting and Mailing before using anyone else's Groups & Ops so that you understand what it is doing.
It is worth the time investment if you are serious about making gold. No Failsafe Operations included yet for this currently. There is a plan to add that net in the future." %}

They've been modified for my own general purpose, server, etc. Thank you goldfarm kings and queens for sharing!

## What is included in this TSM Group w/ Operations?

This is what available TSM Groups & Operation are available:

- All TSM content up to 8.3 content available - all expansions
- Basic TSM Auction Operations for available groups:
    - Current Content has %dbmarket operations
    - Rarer items with dbregionalmarket operations
    - Unique item markets with their own individual Auction house operation that bounce around in the market but sell well
- Crafting Operations kept low to restock around once a week on high pop servers

## Why only Auction, Crafting, and Mailing Operations?
Because they work first off! Some of the other services like TSM Destroy & Warehouse are buggy at the moment with shuffling items back and forth so not including them until they're patched and working consistently.

## Why are you including YOUR mailing Operation Mozzletoff? Are you trying to rip us off?
Yes.

(obviously JK) But I'd like for your to see how to divide up and mainly focused for the bigger Operational/Infrastructure Goldfarm folks who are alt heavy (like myself with 70+ 120 toons). Micromaning bags is an absolute trash panda experience without TSM Mailing. TSM makes this experience 100% manageable now.

## How do I remove YOUR Mailing Operations Mozzletoff?
What you need to do is going into /tsm > Select Operations > Expand Mailing > Select any non-#default Mailing Operation to see which group items go where. change the name of the Operation & the name of the character.

## Do a Reload/UI on each Import!
TSM Errors out at times when importing back to back when dealing with heavier item heavy tsm groups. To avoid imprts missing items or subgroups, ensure to do a /reloadui after each import.

## Your group is missing items. Why?
These groups are customized to my needs. Please send item suggestions [here](https://github.com/Gunnydelight/mozzletoff-wow-goldfarm-site/issues). 100% open to get stuff added to the **official repo** here.

## Can I combine your groups?
Absolutely. I made the groups smaller and more targetted so people can flex how and where they want to make main group and sub-groups in their tsm operations. this allows imports to fail less.

# Getting started

## Where do I begin?
