# Overview

This is a melting pot of various **public-facing** Gold Farmer's pastebins from the following people:

They've been modified for my own general purpose, server, etc. Thank you goldfarm kings and queens for sharing!

## **Mindset of TSM Auction operations**
I keep my **AH Operations** with the mindset below:
<br>
<br>

**DBMarket** - Current and Frequently posted Item(s)

**dbregionhistorical** - Lesser posted, rarer Pre-Current content posted Item(s)

**Unique Group per Item(s)** - What I consider profitable that is a unique market(s) which caused me to post in their own seperate group so I can micro-manage the market

**Transmog** - dbregionmarketavg and agressive undercutting (>1000 I sell to vendor but up to you and your server!)
<br>
<br>

Proper reference resource to use when creating AH operations: [TSM Custom Prices KB article](http://support.tradeskillmaster.com/display/KB/Custom+Prices)

## **What is included in this TSM Group w/ Operations?**

This is what available **TSM Groups & Operations** are available:

- All **TSM content** up to **8.3 content** available - all expansions
- Basic **TSM Auction Operations** for available groups:
    - Current Content has **%dbmarket operations**
    - Rarer items with **dbregionalmarket operations**
    - **Unique item markets** with their own individual Auction house operation that bounce around in the market but sell well
- **Crafting Operations** kept low to restock around once a week on high pop servers

Open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Gunnydelight/mozzletoff-wow-goldfarm-site/issues) if you **identify item(s) missing** you'd like to get added.

## **Why only Auction, Crafting, and Mailing Operations?**
Because they work first off! Some of the other services like **TSM Destroy** & **Warehouse** are buggy at the moment with shuffling items back and forth so not including them until they're patched and working consistently.

## **Why are you including YOUR mailing Operation Mozzletoff? Are you trying to rip us off?**
Yes.

(_obviously JK_) I'd like for your to see how to divide up and mainly focused for the bigger Operational/Infrastructure Goldfarm folks who are alt heavy (like myself with 70+ 120 toons). Micromaning bags is an absolute trash panda experience without TSM Mailing. TSM makes this experience 100% manageable now.

{% include note.html content="Remove TSM Mail Operations" %}

## **How do I remove YOUR Mailing Operations Mozzletoff?**
What you need to do is going into **/tsm** > Select **Operations** > Expand **Mailing** > Select any **non- #default** Mailing Operation to see which group items go where. change the name of the Operation & the name of the character.

## **Do a Reload/UI on each Import!**
**TSM** errors out at times when importing back to back when dealing with heavier item heavy tsm groups. To avoid imports missing items or subgroups, ensure to do a **/reloadui** after each import.

## **Your group is missing items. Why?**
These groups are customized to my needs. Please send item suggestions [here](https://github.com/Gunnydelight/mozzletoff-wow-goldfarm-site/issues). 100% open to get stuff added to the **official repo** here. Click **New Issue** to create an issue.

## **Can I combine your groups?**
Absolutely. I made the groups smaller and more targetted so people can flex how and where they want to make main group and sub-groups in their tsm operations. this allows imports to fail less.

## **Should I make any changes**
I would encourage it as E-V-E-R-Y server's economy is different.
<br>
<br>

A great place to start is the **TSM Crafting** operations to adjust where you'd like to make and where not to. I kept the crafting on the low side for daily or frequent profession crafting to restock supply. For you seasoned gold farmed who can invest a lot of gold into making a plethora of current content, I'd recommend you make that adjust to where it makes sense for you!

# Getting started

## **Where do I begin?**
You can see the individual tsm group w/ operations listed [here](https://github.com/Gunnydelight/mozzletoff-wow-goldfarm-site/tree/gh-pages/tsm-groups)

You can also see the Readme file at the bottom of that page to go to each file containing the TSM Import
Select whichever groups you'd like to use.

## **Restack Groups to your liking!**
Due to current TSM limitation, when TSM groups get to large it times out and doesnt import.

Thus I've made the groups smaller and digestible. Once you **import** and do your ** /reload ** or ** /reloadui **, you can stack up the groups as you see fit!

An example of this would be to create a parent group called **BFA Professions** and stack all the **BFA-P** groups into that as a child/sub group. **Raw mats** group combined another example! It is up to you!
