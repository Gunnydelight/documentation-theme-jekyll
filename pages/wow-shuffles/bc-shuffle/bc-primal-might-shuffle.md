## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  Use the spread sheet to understand if buying the mats and shuffling on your server is worth the profit (.95 for auction
2.  If you notice Primal Mana as an example is EXTREMELY expensive, consider doing x5 man group farms for those mats vs buying off auction house to save overall mats cost.
3.  EVERY DAY WE SHUFFILIN' using the Spreadsheet to understand profit margins :)
```

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware of:

1. Create a TSM/Auctionator Shopping list to buy mats on the chearp side if you'd be doing this shuffle
2. Ensure you leverage Transmute Master going into this to increase profit margins, its required IMO on most servers.
3. Advertising WTB Bulk trade chat advertisement to increase your profits. Takes time, but may find multiboxer / regular bulk sellers who can sell you mats for cheap #MyFavorite
