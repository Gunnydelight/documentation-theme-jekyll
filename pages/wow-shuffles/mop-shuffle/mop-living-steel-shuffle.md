## Prerequisites for the Shuffle
In order to do this shuffle you must:

* Get Alchemy MOP Profession
* Be a [Transmute Master](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=29482/transmutation-master)
* Create MOP Potions or Flasks in order to learn [Riddle of Steel](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=130326/riddle-of-steel#comments) or [Transmute: Living Steel](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=114780/transmute-living-steel).

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  Use the spread sheet to understand if this is profitable or not.
2.  If the area of profit for this is acceptable, than it is time to shuffle! Go to **next step**. If not

profitable than revisit this shuffle at a later date.
3.  Buy the **exact** required mats for the shuffle. Do the cooldown, post on the Auction House & profit!
```

## Tips and Tricks
To change your Alchemy specialization (e.g., from Elixir or Potions to Transmutation), open the professions window and click the small red circle to the left of the specialization (NOT the profession skill level). Then do the applicable quest for the specialization you want.
The more alts you stack, the more daily CDs you have. There is a snow ball effect component that allows you to separate yourself from the competition.
