* Be a **Gnomish Engineer** Specialist vs **Goblin Engineer** Specialist to do this mount creation _tho **Goblin engineering** has its own individual mount_.
* Learn the mount from the vendor!

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  Ensure you pick up Gnomish Engineering for this mount
2.  Max out WOD Engineering with a max skill.

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this shuffle, be aware of the following:

* Scan the Auction House daily and frequently for cheaper mats to stay ahead of the competition!
* You can save a lot of mats cost with **Spirits of harmony** to turn into **Ghost Iron ore** and into **Living Steel**... 3 parts of the required mats for this mount!
