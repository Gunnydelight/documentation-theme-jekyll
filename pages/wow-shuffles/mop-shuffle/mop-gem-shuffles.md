## Prerequisites for the Shuffle
In order to do this shuffle you must:

* Learn MOP Alchemy from [Poisoncrafter Kil'zit](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=65186/poisoncrafter-kilzit) in order to Transmute
* Learn Jewelcrafting from the MOP vendor [Mai the Jade Shaper](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=65098/mai-the-jade-shaper) in order to create Panther Mounts.

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  Prospect any of the MOP ores to earn green or blue quality gems (listed above).
2.  You may also get these mats off the Auction House of farm. I'd recommend buying the ore when prices are generally lower on your server.
3.  You will need to get Golden Lotus'. Either buy them off the Auction house or trade Spirits of Harmony
4.  On your Alchemist containing Transmute Master, begin to transmute the blue MOP gems.
5.  Once the Blue MOP gems are acquired, you can post the raw mats on the AH to sell or shuffle into Panthem mounts.
6.  To understand Panter mount shuffles, you can find that shuffle in the Reference link at the bottom of this page.
```

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware of the following:

* Be a [Transmute Master](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=29482/transmutation-master) in order to proc extra MOP Blue Gems.
* Goblin character earn +15 alchemy through their racial skill.
* Keep an eye out on the AH for the mats involved in this farm. I'd recommend that you even favorite the item in the AH. This way when the prices get low, you can buy them up. Mounts tend to hold value over time, thus the term you hear often, money printing machine when you earn these craftables.
