## Prerequisites for the Shuffle
In order to do this shuffle you must:

* Unlock **MOP content** at **level 80**.
* Get MOP Engineering from [Sally Fizzlefury](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=55143/sally-fizzlefury).
* Max out **75/75** for **MOP Engineering**, can use **Wow-Professions** to get there [here](https://www.wow-professions.com/guides/pandaria-engineering-leveling).
* Pick up [Schematic Chief Engineer Jards Journal](https://www.wowhead.com/item=100910/schematic-chief-engineer-jards-journal#comments) from various MOP mobs (check out the comments).
* Have enough mats to perform the daily [Jard's Peculiar Energy Source](https://www.wowhead.com/item=94113/jards-peculiar-energy-source).
* Have enough [Living Steel](https://www.wowhead.com/item=72104/living-steel) to craft Sky Golem or even the other various Jard Items.

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  When you max MOP Engineering, earn and learn Schematic Chief Engineer Jards Journal to do the daily cooldown.
2.  Have enough mats to perform the daily cooldown which is mentioned in the required mats above.
3.  Daily and consistently, do the daily cooldowns.
```

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware of the following:

* Max **MOP Engineering** before trying to earn the **Schematic**. It won't drop now like it did on release at 1 engineering.
* **Scan the Auction** daily for cheap **Ghost Iron Ore & Bars**, **Trillium ore and bars**, **Living Steel**. There are rare times I can buy in bulk, essentially restocking more daily cooldowns to continues the factory.
* Scan regularly for cheap Spirits of Harmony. You can go to the Spirit of Harmony vendor. The Alliance trader is Krystel, while Danky works for the Horde.
* Check out The Lazy Goldmakers write up for Maximizing Profit with Living Steel [here](https://thelazygoldmaker.com/maximizing-profit-living-steel).
* Alts armies are your friend here! The more alts with engineers is one Sky Golem a month as long as you can keep up with the mat requirements! As an alt o holic, this is one of the reasons that this is my favorite. Steady consistent gold with my alts with no effort once leveled with this MOP profession.
