## Tips and Tricks
When doing this shuffle, be aware of the following:

* Scan the Auction House daily and frequently for cheaper mats to stay ahead of the competition!
* You can save a lot of mats cost with **Spirits of harmony** to turn into **Ghost Iron ore** and into **Living Steel**... 3 parts of the required mats for this mount!
