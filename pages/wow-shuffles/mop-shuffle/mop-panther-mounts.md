## Prerequisites for the Shuffle
In order to do this shuffle you must:

* Be level 85.
* Earn Jewelcrafting from the MOP vendor [Mai the Jade Shaper](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=65098/mai-the-jade-shaper).
* Earn Exalted with the faction [Order of the Cloud Serpent](https://www.wowhead.com/faction=1271/order-of-the-cloud-serpent)
* Once exalted, learn the Panther designed from [San Redscale](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=58414/san-redscale)
* Purchase [Orb of Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=83092/orb-of-mystery) from [Big Keech](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=61650/big-keech) in Vale of Eternal Blossom.

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  The biggest step is earning exalted for Order of the Cloud Serpent. This tends to gate a lot of gold farmers in general from stepping into this market making competition generally less.
2.  Take a look at the Auction House to see if Spirits of Harmony are cheap to purchase, preferably in bulk, on your server.
2.  If yes, you will take those newly purchased Spirits of Harmonys and take them to the Spirit of Harmony vendor for purchasing Ghost Iron Ore or Trillium Ore.
3.  If you are not able to purchase, you always have the option to farm. I would recommend Valley of the Four winds.
4.  Once you possess the Ore, begin prospecting. I would recommend a macro which you can find below under reference links.
4.  Go to Big Keech the vendor to purchase the Orb of Mastery
5.  Continue to be amazing!
```

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware of the following:

* Continue to daily check for Spirits of Harmony cheap. You may be able to pick up some bulk buy to keep yourself in the market.
* Use the prospect macro below to make your prospecting easier:
```
