* Profession of BFA Alchemy at 50 points for your alts, max BFA on your Silas' Flask maker
* Daily check the Auction House for cheap BFA herbs to do the daily anchor weed cool down
* Ensure Rank 3 for your Alchemy Proffession cooldowns to save up on mats to increase profits. Each rank matters!

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  Have an alt army to take advantage of this shuffle. Each alchy alt with this CD adds to the profit margin and snow balls up your profit.

2.  Learn BFA Alchy and level to 50 skill to learn Transmute: Herbs to Anchor Weed.

3.  Use the Google Sheets calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18t0sfZT_I6rNKFZAHyigGiRvboeDdYX4-L9R5BvPq7w/edit#gid=0 to understand profits margin before attempting the shuffle.

4.  Scout the Auction House for Cheese BFA herbs in order to do the Daily CD.

5.  Perform the Transmute: Herbs to Anchor Weed's each day on each BFA Alchemy alt.

6.  Complete the Alchemy: Silas's Tools of the Trade quest line in order to use Silas' Potion of Prosperity: https://ptr.wowhead.com/item=156633/silas-potion-of-prosperity when going to craft.

7.  When you possess enough mats and ready to transmute, use the Silas' potion each hour in order to proc Silas' Potion of Prosperity: https://ptr.wowhead.com/item=156633/silas-potion-of-prosperity.

8.  Craft as many flasks in that 10 minute window.

9.  Repeat this process daily to ensure a surplus of Flasks on the Auction House.
```



## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware the more alts you have, the more this gold farm method ramps up in gold earning potential. You can still absolutely earn gold with this not being an alt army, it just won't be as much but profits still exist.

For alt armies, I noticed I am making so much stacks of flasks that I begun selling Anchor Weed stacks. Can do that or just save them for later if you'd like.

Periodically throughout the day scan the action house for the BFA Herbs cheap as those mats are required for the Daily Anchor Weed CD.

Ensure you possess and leverage Sila's Potion of Prosperity with Rank 3 Flask cooldowns
