## Prerequisites for the Shuffle
In order to do this shuffle you must:

* Be level 100 in order to enable L3 Garrison to be optimal. Be level 90 to unlock garrison.
* Get WOD Alchemy from the L1+ Alchemy hut in your Garrison.
* Get L3 Garrison (to increase the amount of Alchemical Catalysts you can make per toon).

## Step by Steps explanation
In order to be able to do this shuffle, you must do the following:

```
1.  Either Setup a L3 Garrison with L3 Alchemy hut in order to continue to produce Alchemical Catalysts or
1A. Buy your Mats of the Auction House for Alchemical Catalysts craft OR
1B. Buy your Alchemical Catalysts straight from the Auction House if cheap enough.
2.  My opinion is to do all three - 1, 1A, and 1B. This will allow you to increase the most of Alchemical Catalysts you can create but any one of these are fine.
3.  Mass produce the T1 Trinket: Stone of the Wind Trinket.
4.  Sell to the vendor of your choice for Raw gold
5.  GG and Enjoy!
```

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware of the following:

* Add the items in **"Items Involved in this Shuffle"** section to your Auction House favorite to monitor when they get cheap to buy in bulk.
* You can use your L3 Herb Garden to Produce Frostweed to increase profit margins when vendor selling vs buying 100% raw mats off the AH.
* Keep an eye on the Auction House regularly for cheap mats!
