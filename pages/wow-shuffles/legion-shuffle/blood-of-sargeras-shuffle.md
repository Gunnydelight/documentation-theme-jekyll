* Be around level 110 in order to do the Blood of Sargeras farm.
* Equip [Boon of the Bloodhunter](https://www.wowhead.com/item=140219/boon-of-the-bloodhunter) on your shoulders item.
* Be Revered with **The Wardens** to buy the Boon from [Marin Bladewing](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=107379/marin-bladewing). If you have one character with Revered, you may make a BOA Shoulder Heirloom item, equip Boon of the Bloodhunter and mail off the upgraded shoulders.

## Step by Steps explanation

```
1.  Log in to your single account or multibox accounts.
2.  Run your toons or multibox accounts to the Seagulls Rock in Azsuna.
2.  Equip your Boon of the blood hunter shoulders.
3.  Group up the seagull and aoe clear them.
4.  Loot your Bloodhunter's Quarry on all your toons
5.  Log out for a couple of hours.

```

## Tips and Tricks
When doing this farms, be aware of the following:

* Earn Revered with The Wardens with one toon. Create a Heirloom shoulders. Equip the Boon. Mail off to your alts!
* As a multiboxer, this is one of my niche farms I use to create a lot of Legion R43 crafts and Dreamleaf purchases for no effort.
* Earn the R3 when Crafting to save yourself mats for Tailoring, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking etc
* Pair up this farm with Daily profession cooldowns and honestly... you're set. Do that for a month and you'll be surprised at the collection you begin to gather.
