My name is **Derric Bartholomew** aka **Mozzletoff**. I am a Husband and Father first, World of Warcraft Goldfarming Content Creator through Twitch, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram... you get the idea.
<br>
<br>

I decided to create this website _(via Github, Github Pages, Ruby & Jekyll)_ to solve a simple problem. There is mountains... of Warcraft data... This website is to pool together all the Gold Farming related material for gold farmers to have a single, reliable website to find relevant gold farming information from various **Content Creators**.
<br>
<br>

As I build this website and add on to it, I have a main focus in my mind... ease of navigation and easy to location information. That's it.
