## Quick Intro
My name is **Derric Bartholomew** aka **Mozzletoff**. I am a Husband and Father of 3 first. We currently live in the US on the east coast in Richmond VA. Previously, we're from south NJ right outside of Philly. We moved down to VA for school and stayed for the jobs.

### What kicked off gaming for you Mozz?
First game played was Super Mario 3 on NES when I was 5. I got to watch my Mom and Dad play while my brother and I sat there for what was probably only 10 minutes but at the time felt like hours...

Second with Final Fantasy with my brother a dad.

## Prior Service record
I am prior service, having served 6 years _(honorable discharge)_ in the NJ & VA National Guard. Deployed 1 time over sea's and multiple times state side for Hurricane Katrina & 5+ multiple state emergencies as/when needed. I had enjoyed my service and went in with one goal in mind... college education and to serve my country. I did both.
<br>
<br>

## Education
I went to college for a BS in Criminal Justice with a minor in Business while working full time. It took me 5 years /cringe. The minor helps me more today than my major. I have various certification in AWS, Comp TIA _(still counts!)_, Scrum Master, Product Owner, SAFe concepts, you get the idea...
<br>
<br>

## Current Career
I now have a full time career working for an Enterprise in big banking working in Operations as a Production Support/AWS Engineer.

## Temporary Break until Real Life settles down & newborne gets healthy
My main engagement to everyone use to be [Twitch TV](https://www.twitch.tv/mozzletoff) until the birth of my daughter back in june, born 2 months early. That is where I almost lost my wife and kiddo. Wife is absolutely fine now and we're in this hardship together <3 My daughter is who atm is stealing most of my attention physically, emotionally, spiritually, the list goes on - she's got it.

Ms Katelynn was born with a rare [lymphatic system](https://www.livescience.com/26983-lymphatic-system.html) disorder currently up in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. It is so rare that there is not an official name & two years ago, would have been a death sentence... How ever CHOP calls its a Central Line malformation meaning her Lymphatic Central line does not connect to her vascular system / veins. Thus her lymphatic central line dilates pushing lymphatic fluid to her [subcutaneous layer](https://www.verywellhealth.com/subcutaneous-tissue-1068882)/3rd layer space in the skin causing severe edema. There are no studies to tell us next step but having leading doctors in lympathics work to thing of mechanical solutions to get her to properly draining we are told they will continue to work to do multiple [anastomosis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002231.htm) between her lymphatic & vascualar systems to allow proper drainage. Until then it is fighting infections chances, provide support for her heart rate, blood pressure management, respitory support as she intubated, constant pain management, child development concerns and limitation, blood cots from being bed ridden, nuerological concerns from constant sedition... the list can go on but you get the idea <3 As such I am working offline as if I click Go Live i'm likely to be in constant interuptions from phone calls or just upset due to the situation which isn't the live content I want to put out. Take care of yourself first folks - A L W A S Y S!

## WOW Content Creator
Let's switch gears a little bit... Outside of all that, I am a **World of Warcraft Goldfarming Content Creator** through Twitch, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram... you get the idea. I decided to create this website _(via Github, Github Pages, Ruby & Jekyll)_ to solve a simple problem. There is mountains... of Warcraft data... This website is to pool together all the Gold Farming related material for gold farmers to have a single, reliable website to find relevant gold farming information from various **Content Creators**.
<br>
<br>

 As I build this website and add on to it, I have a main focus in my mind... ease of navigation and easy to location information. That's it. I'll continue to collapse relevant, still useable content for WOW GoldFarming into the site with 100% credit called out to the content creator and their social media(s) which is the official source.
<br>
<br>

Feedback is encouraged. What am I missing? Layout sucks, should it be changed? What should be here that isn't? Youre missing active & relevant, no click baiting content creators along the top!! Let me know, I would love to hear about it.
<br>
