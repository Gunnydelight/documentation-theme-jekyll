## Overview

Welcome! This site is for World of Warcraft gold farmers to find gold farming related material in a single location in an easy to navigate using the top & side nav bars.

## What is different about your site than the other 100 out there?
I, like some of you, find myself going to 5+ multiple sites to gather information.
This website's purpose is to pool together content creators relevant & usable content to a single website. When dealing with content creators, they tend to put out content differently over time. Here the information will be presented the same consistent _(as Jekyll helps with that here through various commands)_ feel across the various Expansions.

What I’m looking to do is to “melting pot” WOW Goldfarming resources while crediting original Content creators sources together for Users to just find in a single spot.


## Table of Contents - How the Shuffles will be displayed

# Getting started

## Where do I begin?
To get started, see our [Goldfarm Guides section](https://gunnydelight.github.io/mozzletoff-wow-goldfarm-site/index.html).

## What type of Gold farm content?
I personally am a casual gold farmer. I try to make the most amount of gold with the limited time available to play. I have over 90+ level 110-120 alts leveraging daily CDs/professions and TSM Sniping/flipping. Type of gold farming content you can expect to find here:

* maximizing **Daily rotations** for steady gold income
* Shuffles from **Vanilla** to **Current content** inside WOW
* Multiple _Herbing_ routes for each Herb
* Multiple _Mining_ routes for each Ore
* 5 man Group & x5 Multibox farms
* **TSM 3** groups & Operations
* **TSM 4** groups & Operations
* Showcase other current/active WOW Gold Farm Content  Creators
