## What is the Twitch requirements to get listed on this website??
* Twitch Affiliate+ or Partner. This baseline shows a commit to being a serious Content Creator and not a temporary fleeting decision.
* Still currently streaming or posting Gold Farm content _(does **NOT** need to be dedicated)_.
* Breaks are Okay _(AND HEALTHY)_, 6 month+ of no Content will likely result in a delisting from Twitch. Just make sure if/when you decide you come back to contact me on any of the socials above to be added back in.

## What is the YouTube requirements to get listed on this website??
* 300+ Subscribers
* 20+ Videos
* Covering Goldfarm or gold making relevant content!
* No expire to remove URL's from YouTube Content Creators like Twitch requirement above. As as long as the information covered in the VODs stay relevant to current WOW content, you'll stay there as a libary source of video's that people may use.

## Mozzle, why haven't you already show cased my work?!
It is impossible _(so I'm finding out)_ to keep in constant **"know"** of who is working on Gold Farm content. Just reach out to me and ask!

I'd like to think I'm approachable. I'm ensuring there is no "gate keeping" when it comes to Gold Farming content and remaining Switzerland. Thus the point of this page to level set expectation.

## Can more than one Content Creator be featured on a shuffle?
Yes, I would need an Google Sheet _(or alternative spreadsheet online hosted)_ to host. I would then add your social media's to the bottom of that content page

## I'm a Gold Farming Content Creator on Twitch & Youtube, Why havent you added me yet??
It is impossible _(so I'm finding out)_ to keep in constant **"know"** of who is working on Gold Farm content. Just reach out to me and ask. No gate keeping, just meet the requirements mentioned above.
