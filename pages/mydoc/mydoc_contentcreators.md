## What type of gold farm information from Content Creators are you looking for??
Relevant gold farming information you'd like publicized consisting of:

```
1.  Profession Gold increasing Shuffles
2.  Extensive/Complete TSM Groups (with or without Operations)
3.  Herb and/or Mining Routes with screenshots (may remove this later, not sure... undecided)
4.  PreCaged Pet World goldfarms
5.  BOE Mount Farms
```

The way your information will be presented will follow the template in the completed guides on this site which can be located [here](https://gunnydelight.github.io/mozzletoff-wow-goldfarm-site/example.html)

## What is the Twitch requirements to get listed on this website??
* Twitch Affiliate+ or Partner. This baseline shows a commit to being a serious Content Creator and not a temporary fleeting decision to do Gold Farm content.
* Still currently streaming or posting Gold Farm content _(does NOT need to be dedicated)_.
* Breaks are Okay _(AND HEALTHY)_, 5 month of no content will likely result in a delisting.

## What is the YouTube requirements to get listed on this website??
* 300+ Subscribers
* 10+ Videos
* Cover Goldfarm Content!
* No expire to remove URL's from YouTube Content Creators like Twitch requirement above. As as long as the information covered in the VODs stay relevant to current WOW content.

## Mozzle, why haven't you already show cased my work?!
It is impossible _(so I'm finding out)_ to keep in constant **"know"** of who is working on Gold Farm content. Just reach out to me and ask!

I'd like to think I'm approachable. I'm ensuring there is no "gate keeping" when it comes to Gold Farming content and remaining Switzerland. Thus the point of this page to level set expectation.

## Can more than one Content Creator be featured on a shuffle?
Yes, I would need an Google Sheet _(or alternative spreadsheet online hosted)_ to host. I would then add your social media's to the bottom of that content page

## I'm a Gold Farming Content Creator on Twitch & Youtube, Why havent you added me yet??
It is impossible _(so I'm finding out)_ to keep in constant **"know"** of who is working on Gold Farm content. Just reach out to me and ask!
