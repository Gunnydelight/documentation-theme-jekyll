## ANOTHER Goldfarm website?

Yes... sort of? The amount of information that is out there for WOW Goldfarm is wide & vast.

I, like some of you, find myself going to 5+ multiple sites to gather information. What I'm looking to do is to "melting pot" WOW Goldfarming resources _while crediting original Content creators sources_ together for Users to just find in a single spot.

## Whats the difference from the other Gold farm sites?

The farm is the farm. The shuffle is the shuffle. That isn't changing _(obviously)_. So whats the point?

The navigation for the amount information here allows the large amount of data to start to become digestible for you, the Gold Farmer. This happens with the:

* easy to use **side nav bar**
**sub menus** inside the side nav bar
* each to use **top nav bar**
* **On** and **Off** choise for side nav bar
* **Tags** to link article content together (like AWS Instance tagging)

With the my mind set above, it is an attempt to collapse & bring together relevant gold farm information to a single source & improve the navigation experience for folks.

## Who are you?

I am a Husband to 1 _(Kappa)_, a father to 3 _(two boys and a girl)_ and always a gamer.
