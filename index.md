## ANOTHER Goldfarm website?

Yes... sort of? The amount of information that is out there for WOW Goldfarm is wide & vast.

I, like some of you, find myself going to 5+ multiple sites to gather information. What I'm looking to do is to "melting pot" WOW Goldfarming resources _while crediting original Content creators sources_ together for Users to just find in a single spot.

## Whats the difference from the other Gold farm sites?

The farm is the farm. The shuffle is the shuffle. That isn't changing _(obviously)_. So whats the point?

The navigation for the amount information here allows the large amount of data to start to become digestible for you, the Gold Farmer. This happens with the:

* easy to use **side nav bar**
**sub menus** inside the side nav bar
* each to use **top nav bar**
* **On** and **Off** choise for side nav bar
* **Tags** to link article content together (like AWS Instance tagging)

With the my mind set above, it is an attempt to collapse & bring together relevant gold farm information to a single source & improve the navigation experience for folks.

## Who are you Mozzletoff?

First game played was Super Mario 3 on NES when I was 5. I got to watch my Mom and Dad play while my brother and I sat there for what was probably only 10 minutes but at the time felt like hours...

Second with Final Fantasy with my brother a dad.

## How do I navigate this website?
Rely on the **Navigation improvements** on the site & the site **Tagging** at the bottom of each article for finding similiar liked articles. Use the top bar, side bar and tags at the bottom of relatable articles.

## What type of Gold farm content?
I personally am a casual gold farmer. I try to make the most amount of gold with the limited time available to play. I have over 90+ level 110-120 alts leveraging daily CDs/professions and TSM Sniping/flipping. Type of gold farming content you can expect to find here:

* maximizing **Daily rotations** for steady gold income
* Shuffles from **Vanilla** to **Current content** inside WOW
* Multiple _Herbing_ routes for each Herb
* Multiple _Mining_ routes for each Ore
* 5 man Group & x5 Multibox farms

Scroll to the top navigation bar and select feedback. It'll open your local machine's default Mailbox option to send me your feedback.

Please include any erroneous and/or outdated content _(provide the URL)_, improvements suggestions. I will check this infrequeny/bi-weekly to **GitHub's Issue tracker** valid issues with the site to improve.
